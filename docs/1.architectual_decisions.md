Communication Pattern (**OPTIONAL**)
(Internal Pub/Sub):
Publish: When a comment is saved, your code emits an internal event: eventEmitter.emit('comment.created', data).
Subscribe: You have a separate "Notification Listener" in your code that stays quiet until it hears that event. When it does, it writes the row to the Notifications database table.
API Style
- REST (for comments, **PAGINATION TO BE IMPLEMENTED LATER**)
- WebSockets (**OPTIONAL**, if want to make notifications real-time, that would need a seperate notification service which is tedious for now, but it ensures SRP for each container because notifications can serve different things)
  



should notifications be a separate service, currently my services are based on business domains
- ideally yes, notifiactions should be able to handle other domains
