Auth
- using google as main sign in method
- option to link with 42 account
- once linked, able to view all projects (categories: in progress/done)
- another option when linked, is to customize and set the staff variable to true, so that its considered as an admin
- as an admin, CRUD on everyones forum comments, and is able to view all projects instead of in progress/done 
- need to ensure ownership, students can only modify their own comments, details

Forum
- flat data, all comments equal (maybe in the future only add replies)
- able to @mention someone as a reply
- code blocks are in markdown, long ones will be minimized
- each comments have upvotes/downvotes
- if forum is long, should do lazy loading, where it only paginates when you scroll
- pub sub is probably suitable here, as project subscription is an act of subscribing, so notifications on forum will be sent (actually not so important)
- i think these dont have to be real-time, a refresh is enough, maybe every 5 minutes if the user has never refreshed before

Chat
- 1-to-1
- only can message friends, so need CRUD for friends (add friends, remove friends) (to satisfy major module)
- can accept friend requests, and accepts dm
- new message DM option, enter user intra_id or name
- real-time chat, persistent message history
- chat bubbles only for friends on the right
- able to see online/typing/read receipts (required to complete the real-time module)
