Forum
- flat data, all comments equal (maybe in the future only add replies)
- able to @mention someone as a reply
- code blocks are in markdown, long ones will be minimized
- each comments have upvotes/downvotes
- if forum is long, should do lazy loading, where it only paginates when you scroll
- pub sub is probably suitable here, as project subscription is an act of subscribing, so notifications on forum will be sent (actually not so important)
- i think these dont have to be real-time, a refresh is enough, maybe every 5 minutes if the user has never refreshed before
