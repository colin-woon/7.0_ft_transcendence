Frontend
React - most supported, lots of UI libraries
Typescript - type safety
Tailwind - most supported
Vite - Popular tool, easy to setup

Backend
Auth & Real-time Chat
Java 
- verbose, strict typing, useful for Auth and security
- mature ecosystem
- Quarkus instead of Springboot because its more container specific, hot reloads are fast


**AUTH**
**API Style**
- REST (but security focused, OAuth 2.0 is built on REST standards, easier to implement JWT)

**Java Stack**
**Coding Style:** Service-Repository Pattern + Anemic Domain Model (classes wiht only private fields, getters and setters, no OOP object methods/functions) (easy to serialize to JSON for smooth interaction with other services)
**Folder Structure**: (DTO = Data Transfer Object)
```yaml
services/auth/src/main/java/org/acme
├── /api           <-- Controllers (Defines endpoints, strictly input/output, only http stuff here)
├── /service       <-- Business Logic (The "Brain", handles OAuth, Vault calls) (interface (what it can do) & its implementation (how it does them) goes here, c++ eg: .hpp, .cpp)
├── /model         <-- Entities (similar to .h structs in C, but exactly maps 1:1 with DB tables)
├── /dto           <-- DTOs (The "Public Structs" Data for other API requests/responses) (similar to .h in C)
└── /repository    <-- DB Access (Where you write SQL/JPQL queries)

src/main/resources (any config files will go here like .ini or .yaml)
```
**Static Validation:** Error Prone (similar to -Wall -Wextra -Werror, but will provide fix suggestions also, javac is built in and will do type checking already)
**Runtime Validation**: Jakarta Bean Validation (Hibernate Validator) (gives code shortcuts (annotations @) to validate data)
**Framework**: Quarkus (Jakarta REST) (avoided spring because it is bloated, slow, and not container specific)
**Libraries**: 
- Hibernate ORM with Panache (MAKE SURE ITS Repository Pattern, Active Record has tight coupling) (hibernate itself is too verbose, panache is a wrapper on top of it, other option was jakarta data, but it is not as mature)
- (OPTIONAL)  need to research Lombok, see if its worth using it to generate getters and setters, AI said Quarkus automatically converts public to private during runtime, so you can keep fields as public so you code faster
**Formatting & Linting Tool:** Spotless Maven Plugin. (with Google Java Format, non-configurable, opinionated, able to focus more on code logic instead of style) (formats everything, even non .java files)


**CHAT**
**API Style**
- REST (for fetching chat history, sending message)
- WebSockets (real-time messaging, receiving message)

**Java Stack**
- same as auth
**Additonal Libraries:** 
- quarkus-redis-client (for caching online users, typing status, read receipts, pub/sub for messaging queues, OPTIONAL mutiny for reactive programming)
- quarkus-websockets-next (more modern, fast and easy to use, but difficult to port, but its okay since we dont plan to change frameworks)


Python
- PEP 8 style guide, use Ruff tool (its both a linter and formatter, written in Rust)
- FastAPI, C-style with structs and dedicated functions for logic handling instead of OOP
- SQLAlchemy for ORM
- Pydantic for type checking

Forum
- rapid development and prototyping
- lots of libraries

DB
Postgres
- most supported, gold standard for relational data
