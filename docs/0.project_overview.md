# Product Overview: 42 Overflow

## 1. Vision
Our project serves as a modernized, community-driven prototype of the 42 Network’s internal management system. While the original Intra focuses on tracking administrative progress, our version shifts the focus toward **collaborative learning** and **real-time peer support**.

## 2. Core Objectives
The primary goal is to create a secure, multi-user web application that bridges the gap between official school documentation and student-led peer support.

* **Security & Identity:** Replicate the 42 authentication flow to ensure a secure entry point, with robust session management.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** Transform static project descriptions into a dynamic, "StackOverflow-style" forum where students can upvote solutions and discuss subject-specific edge cases.
* **Instant Connectivity:** Provide a centralized communication hub (Live Chat) to replace fragmented Slack/Discord servers for better campus integration.

## 3. Key Functional Pillars

### A. Authentication & Profile (The Gatekeeper)
* **Functionality:** Secure system handling sign-up/log-in.
* **Key Features:**
    * Login via 42 OAuth (School Account).
    * Login via Google (External).
    * Profile dashboard displaying user status, project history, and friend lists.
    * **Admin Mode:** Staff users (set via specific flags) can moderate content and view all project tiers.

### B. Project Forum (The Knowledge Base)
* **Functionality:** A specialized board for each 42 project (e.g., `libft`, `minishell`).
* **Key Features:**
    * Threaded discussions with Markdown support (code snippets).
    * Upvote/Downvote system for quality control.
    * "Best Answer" marking system.
    * Lazy loading for performance on long threads.
    * **?** Searching for specific questions or answers

### C. Real-Time Chat (The Community)
* **Functionality:** A live messaging system using WebSockets.
* **Key Features:**
    * Persistent chat history (messages saved to DB).
    * Friend-to-Friend Direct Messaging (1-to-1).
    * Real-time status indicators: Online, Typing..., Read Receipts.


## 4. Technical Stack
* **Gateway:** Nginx
* **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS & Vite.
* **Microservices Backend:** Java Quarkus with Maven, Python FastAPI
* **Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis
* **Containerization:** Docker
